Replacing "tcga_gbm_methylation.tsv" due to the original file being too large.

The original file was downloaded using TCGA biolinks on 10 May 2023. The "TCGA-GBM" project was selected, and "Illumina Human Methylation 450" as "Methylation Beta Value" was downloaded. 

The file was saved in .tsv format and included beta values for 485,578 methylation probes for 156 GBM samples, for which we had clinical data and their IDH-mutation status.
