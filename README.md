The materials are organized into sub-directories for each Figure that includes source code and input datasets. The R package ActivePathways v2.0.3 was used. A Zenodo archive of the R package is available at DOI [10.5281/zenodo.12118089](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12118089)

A few input datasets in Figure 5 require access from the GLASS consortium and can be retrieved from the Synapse database at <https://www.synapse.org> (accession numbers: mRNA: syn31121291; clinical: syn31121219; methylation: syn23594913). A few very large datasets from TCGA are not provided as part of this repository since these are publicly available and their duplication is unnecessary. Download instructions for these files are shown within individual files.
