A few input datasets in Figure 5 require access from the GLASS consortium and can be retrieved from the Synapse database at https://www.synapse.org (accession numbers: mRNA: syn31121291; clinical: syn31121219; methylation: syn23594913). A few very large datasets from TCGA are not provided as part of this repository since these are publicly available and their duplication is unnecessary. Download instructions for these files are shown within individual files.
